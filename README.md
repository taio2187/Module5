# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This assignment was to create a website that would function as a daily task planner.

The current date will automatically appear at the top of the page.

Tasks can be entered into each row, corresponding with the hour when that task is scheduled.

The blue button at the end of the row will save that task, persisting through a page reload.

The rows themselves will automatically color-code, based on the current time of day.

The page is live at https://taio2187.github.io/Module5/
